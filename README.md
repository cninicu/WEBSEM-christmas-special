# Web semantics, Christmas special 


## Description
The main objective of this assignment is to build an OWL ontology using Protégé. The ontology
can be built for the same domain chosen by the students in the previous assignment. The
students will use the version 5.5 of the Protégé ontology editor.

The ontology must meet the following requirements:
 -  At least 20 classes
 -  Different Object Properties and Datatype Properties related to the classes
 -  At least 30 individuals
 -  Disjoint classes
 - Adding some of the following types of axioms to the Object Properties
    - Inverse
    - Symmetry
    - Assymmetry
    - Transitivity
    - Functional  
    - Inverse functional
    - Reflexivity
    - Irreflexivity
- Adding at least 2 property chains restrictions
- Restrictions: allValuesFrom, someValuesFrom, hasValue, cardinality
- Classification of classes and instances through value ranges
    - At least 5 defined classes with conditions of value ranges


## Deliverables

1. christmas.owl file contains the OWL ontology definition, PROTEGE VERSION 5.5

2. https://cninicu.github.io/web-semantics-cs/ contains the explanation document for the assignmenet: 

- Knowledge Model Explanation Story
- Classes
- Relations
